This is just some fun I'm having at generating sound with perl.

I tried using Coro::Generator, which made for some pretty clean
code, but unfortunately the context switching cost is too high.
Maybe it can be optimized.

But I went ahead and re-implemented using perl 'state' variables...
much less pretty but the performance seems great.
